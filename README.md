# Pathfinding-Visualizer
# Built ReactJS application for visualizing pathfinding 
and  implemented  Dijkstra's algorithm. It give shortest path between  starting node and ending node 

Dijkstra algorithm
----->
Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph. It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.
